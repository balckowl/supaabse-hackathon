# What's this product?

This is a website where you can write and post your diary.
One unique feature of this product is that if you make your diary public and submit it, you’ll receive someone else’s public diary by email at 7:00 AM the next morning.
The charm lies in getting a glimpse into a stranger’s life through their diary.
